# Logies codelijsten
This repository contains the controlled vocabularies that were created for the flemish candidate standard [logies-basis](https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/logies-basis/). A controlled vocabulary is a controlled list of possible values for a given property. These lists were defined according to the "Simple Knowledge Organization System".

SKOS is a general datamodel to define and organise concepts that are contained in a codelist. An advantage of skos is that it makes a distinction between the concept and the terms that are used to describe this concept. This allows the user to provide multiple terms, in multiple languages to describe the concept.
